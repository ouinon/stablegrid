# Stablegrid

A basic grid system for use with AngularJS and AngularUI's Bootstrap directives, it includes styling for:

* Buttons
* Dropdown
* Typeahead

You will find the AngularUI project here [AngularUI's version of Bootstrap](https://angular-ui.github.io/#ui-bootstrap).

Please note that StableGrid uses AngularUI - **0.13.0**, which at the time of writing (_2015-06-02_) was only available as a snapshot.

The following directives must be included as modules for in order to work:

```javascript
'ui.bootstrap.dropdown',
'ui.bootstrap.buttons',
'ui.bootstrap.typeahead'
```

Please take a look in **/Demo/demo.html** to see a working example.

A link to a github page will be available soon.
